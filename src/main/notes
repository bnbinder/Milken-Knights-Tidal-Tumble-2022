swerd made getinstance so he didnt have to explicitley call a constructor, he just calls it when calling the get instance function

so it isnt haram to have a constructor, since you never have to call it, only the get instance fucntion



super or get instance? which is better?


he also used setAuto because he didnt have a constructor, so he made a mthod  instead
